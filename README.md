## How To Use
```bash
# Install dependencies
$ yarn

# Start the local development server (on port 4000)
$ yarn start

# Build the production ready code to the /dist folder
$ yarn build
```

You can also run the game in whatever device you have wirelessly by using your ip instead of localhost, for instance **192.168.1.245:4000**. 

It works with live reload as well.
